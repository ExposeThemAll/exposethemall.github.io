                <h1>What is it?</h1>
                <p>Too put simply this is a competiton between members if the school to see who can "link" the highest number of girls. This may seem like an innocent thing, "letting boys be boys" but it has deeper implications</p>

                <h1>Deeper implications</h1>
                <p>This is not some harmless game. No just a thing where "boys can be boys". This has deeper implications. This brings down the value of the girls they "link" to an object, just a number in a sea of numbers. It not only does this it measn that the girls they do link are of no value to them. These girls who think they are happy to be with this boy are brought down to nothing. Eventually they will find out, either by this or by them. And they will be hurt! This has allowed these boys to run willy-dilly hurting anyone they want. Play with whoever they come across! This page may shed some light on the people involved, use the truth as you wish</p>
