            <p>I received <a href="HaiderPhotos/haiderEmail.jpg">this</a> email today, lovely stuff to dig into.</p>
            <p>I think the absolute legend who had the guts to send this (it would be obvious to Haidar on who "snaked" him out) explained the situation quite well in the screenshots themselves</p>
            <p>It is relatively well known that Haidar is one of the biggest fuckboys out there, but we didn't expect him to be homophobic in todays day and age. He seriously needs help in our opinion. Maybe his "hard" caricature is only prevalent because of his own massive insecurities amplified by a misguided and misjudged sense of ego. But hey this isn't therapy</p>
            <p>While we are at it, why not mention the time he killed some fish by pouring disinfectant down the tank, from what we heard it was all for just a few laughs!</p>
            <p>We got a great laugh out of these screenshots:</p>
            <p>Edit: As this gets out more and more stories are coming in, he asks people for nudes and the whole lot. He also gets very rude and spreads destructive rumors</p>
