            <h2>So What's up with this?</h2>
            <p>People like Haidar are dangerous because of how fake they can be. If you knew they are the way they are then you would avoid them. But somehow they keep their doings secret, and also end up being nice to people. Until of course it's too late and they have to show their inner demons to get what they want</p>

            <p>So what happened now? Well he was fake. These screenshots were sent in and show how fake he can be. He's all nice to this girl and makes her feel so special, makes her feel good to be alive. These messages seem like innocent love. That is why you have to read this with the knowledge that Haidar stood her up, twice. And also that Haidar was saying this to multiple people at the same time. Put yourself in the shoe of this girl. You've been told your special, so so special. Your excited to meet someone who you think you have a connection with. Your afraid of how you look, your afraid you might be ugly. He then doesn't show up. You let it go, ask to meet again. He then doesn't show up again. Think of how you would feel. How it would destroy your self-confidence. How it might destroy your self-esteem, you might end up blaming your own looks when they have nothing to do with this.</p>
