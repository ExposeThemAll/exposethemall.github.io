            <h2>Wazzup with this laddie?</h2>
            <p>This guy is the scum of the scum. He got in a relationship, everything seemed happy. Like the movies, or at least it was for the person who he was seeing. But for him it was all a joke. He asked 4 different girls for nudes whilst being in this relationship, this happened less than 2 weeks after they become official. Makes you wonder why he got in a relationship in the first place, perhaps to fill the void left by his massive ego and insecurities</p>

            <h2>Why This Wrong?</h2>
            <p>Let's dissect what he did part by part:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><p>He asked for nudes. Not just asking for nudes but popping up to people who basically don't know him just to ask for nudes, like no conversation beforehand. This is wrong as it is the objectification of women, boiling them down to a sexual level. Using them only for a sexual pleasure then just throwing them away. It is also an extension of his ego as he assumes girls would just give him nudes just cause he asked. This technically does count as sexual harrasment</p></li>
                <li><p>Cheating. He basically cheated on this girl and used her for names-sake. She now is really hurt. She thought this was gonna last long and be something very good. But alas, no. This dickhead fucking screwed it up, she didn't deserve him in the first place. He just used her and then threw her away</p></li>
                <li><p>Lasting Impact. To him this may (ridiculously) seem all innocent with no consequences, but with everything they're are always consequences. The girl he played is left distraught. One might wonder what this effect has on her ability to trust. It has damaged her, forever. It took its toll. These kindah things also cause insecurities in everyone, the girls he asked nudes from probably are a tiny bit more insecure than before, even a tiny bit adds up. Eventually, until the girl is unrecognisable from before.</p></li>
